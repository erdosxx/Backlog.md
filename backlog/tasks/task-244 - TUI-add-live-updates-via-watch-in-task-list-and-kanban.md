## Description

Add live updates to the TUI task list and kanban views using the shared file-watcher. When tasks are created, edited, or archived/moved, the currently open TUI must update in-place without restart. The active filters and sort remain applied, and the current selection is preserved when possible. The feature is enabled by default in interactive TTY sessions and shows a footer indicator with a hotkey to toggle live updates. Updates are incremental (no full reload for single-file changes). If file watching is unavailable, the UI degrades gracefully and clearly indicates that live updates are off.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 TUI updates in-place on file events: create/edit/archive (no restart)
- [ ] #2 Active filters and sort stay applied after every update; no filter reset
- [ ] #3 New task that matches current filter appears within 1s without losing selection
- [ ] #4 Edits that change filter membership move the task accordingly (add/remove/move between statuses)
- [ ] #5 Removal/archive: removed task disappears; if selected, selection falls back to nearest neighbor
- [ ] #6 Incremental updates only; avoid full dataset reload for single-file changes
- [ ] #7 Default ON in interactive TTY; footer shows "Live: ON/OFF"; hotkey toggles watch (e.g., 'w')
- [ ] #8 CLI flag to disable for the session (e.g., --no-watch); defaults to enabled
- [ ] #9 Graceful fallback when file watching is unavailable; show indicator and keep UI usable
- [ ] #10 Tests simulate watch events (stub) to verify list/kanban update flows, filter/selection preservation
- [ ] #11 Docs updated: behavior, indicator, toggle hotkey, CLI flag, limitations
