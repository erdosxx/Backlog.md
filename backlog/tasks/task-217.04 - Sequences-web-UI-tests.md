## Description

Add tests verifying sequences render correctly and move flows trigger appropriate API calls and UI updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Rendering tests validate list page behavior
- [ ] #2 Move flow tests verify API calls and UI updates
- [ ] #3 No regressions in existing UI tests
- [ ] #4 Tests cover Unsequenced rendering and sequencing order in the web UI
- [ ] #5 Tests cover join semantics and blocked moves to Unsequenced (isolated only)
- [ ] #6 No regressions; large datasets scroll smoothly and preserve focus after move
<!-- AC:END -->
